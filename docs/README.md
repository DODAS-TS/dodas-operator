# DODAS Kubernetes operator

Create and delete DODAS clusters as Kubernetes resources (just like pod et al.).

Your deployments will be created and managed by the [InfrastructureManager]()(IM).
To start playing with the operatori we provide a quick start guide with two options:

- using the **[community instance of IM](https://dodas-ts.github.io/dodas-operator/enablingFac/quick-start.md)** (required free registration for evaluation purpose [here]())
- a **[standalone setup](https://dodas-ts.github.io/dodas-operator/standalone/quick-start.md)** where IM will be deployed together with the dodas-operator
